### Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets Challenge: Deep Learning with BERT, data preprocessing with NLP.

The Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets Challenge is a predictive modeling challenge on Kaggle. In this challenge, participants are asked to predict which Tweets are about natural disasters and which are not.

As a part of Data Science Olympians 2023 for Women in Big Data, I took part in this challenge with a team using Deep Learning and NLP techniques including: (i) cleaning data text with lemmatization and pre-processing using TFIDF (ii) analyzing data (iii) modeling data with Logistic Regression, XGBoost, MLP, transformers, and BERT.

### Marketing Campaign Optimization through Data Analysis

Conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on consumer data using Python to uncover insights that boosted targeted advertising effectiveness by 25%. Identified key patterns in campaign acceptance and applied Media-Mix Modeling, optimizing marketing strategies and driving an 18% increase in overall ROI. The project demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making in refining marketing campaigns for maximum impact.

### Credit Risk Modeling and Scorecard Development

Predicted the probability of customer default using consumer loan data between 2007 and 2014 issued by the Lending Club, a US P2P lender made available on Kaggle.
In this project, I used the chi-square and ANOVA F-statistics tests for feature selection and re-engineered the features by analyzing Weight-of-Evidence. I applied Logistic Regression to predict the probability of default and developed a Credit Scorecard. Finally, set a loan cut-off to balance credit scores and approval/rejection rates.

### Customer Churn Prediction and Prevention using Survival Analysis
A developed predictive model for customer churn on 7000 telecom customer data from Kaggle. In this project, I performed survival analysis and measured the impact of switching to specific arrangements by customers by the time they reach a 50% chance of churning out.

### Recommendation for Apparel using Classification and Clustering.
In this project, the top 5 recommendations for a given apparel image were given using Fashion MNIST data with 70,000 images of 10 unique categories of apparel. The data was initially trained and tested with SVM to classify a given apparel. The k-Means algorithm was used to cluster the classified apparel examples into 10 groups and the top 5 closest apparel were recommended based on its cluster.
