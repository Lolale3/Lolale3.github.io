### Credit Risk Modeling and Scorecard Development

Predicted the probability of default for customers using consumer loan data between 2007 and 2014 issued by the Lending Club, a US P2P lender made available on Kaggle.
In this project, I used the chi-square test and ANOVA F-statistics test for feature selection and re-engineered the features by analyzing Weight-of-Evidence. I applied Logistic Regression for predicting the probability of default and developed a Credit Scorecard. Finally, set a loan cut-off to strike a fine balance between credit scores and approval/rejection rates.
